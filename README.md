# Essentials of C++
> Based on C++ courses by Bill Weinman!

This repository compiles C++ code from a variery of sources including "Introduction to Design Patterns in C++ with QT", "Beginning C++", and a few other sources here n there!
The core content is based on the C++ series by Bill Weinman available on LinkedIN Learning and Bill's own [website](https://bw.org/). 

I am also planning on adding content from John Purcell's C++ courses to this repo over-time!

You'll also find some C source files in this repo, they are based on Dan Gookin's work. I have a separate repo compiling Dan's teachings but some random source files will be added here as well!

**Keep Learning, Keep Growing! See ya!!** 

P.S. As the code bases expands the content will be packaged into directories to segregate random source files from project files.
